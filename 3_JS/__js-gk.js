/*

(1) Javascript execute the code synchronously from top to bottom of the script.

(2) semicolon (;) is optional in javascript  but it's good practice to use them at the end of each statement for better readability.

(3) if we want to write multiple statements in one line then we should use semicolon;
ex-console.log("sd"); console.log("sads")

(4) To use only letest features and functions of javascript we should use "use strict" on the first line of the script
